This is my first project, my first website to scrape which is https://www.jumia.ug/phones-tablets/ 
--> A commercial store inAfrica with offices in Uganda. This particular section picks all the product names with 
a class Id of names which is done by inspecting the page source in the browser.

It is very easy and basic, found it fun. I then used pandas to transfer the data I had got into csv which can be
edited in excel or any text editor.

Let me know incase you find any challenge in my code >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
